# StateMachineExample
Directory structure and names of classes:
Assuming that the Java RFQ state machine example application will have the following directory structure:

                |- RfqServiceTest.java
RfqStateMachine.java: 
This class represents the state machine that handles the RFQ (Request for Quote) process. It will implement the state transition logic based on incoming events.
RfqState.java:
This enum represents the possible states of the RFQ process, such as "Initiated", "Quoting", "Quoted", "Rejected", and "Accepted".
RfqEvent.java: 
This enum represents the possible events that can occur during the RFQ process, such as "QuoteRequested", "QuoteReceived", "QuoteRejected", and "QuoteAccepted".
RfqRequest.java: 
This class represents the request sent by the client to initiate the RFQ process. It contains the relevant details such as the product, quantity, and target price.
RfqResponse.java: 
This class represents the response sent by the server in response to a client request. It contains the current state of the RFQ process and any additional information required by the client.
RfqService.java: 
This class provides the business logic for handling RFQ requests and generating responses based on the current state of the RFQ process.
RfqController.java: 
This class is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning the appropriate response. It will use the RfqService to generate responses.
RfqStateMachineTest.java: 
This class will contain the JUnit tests for the RfqStateMachine class.
RfqServiceTest.java: 
This class will contain the JUnit tests for the RfqService class.
User Interface:
Assuming that we will use Swagger to provide the user interface for the Java RFQ state machine example application. The Swagger UI will allow users to submit an RFQ request and view the current state of the RFQ process.

GitHub Integration:
Assuming that we will use GitHub for version control and continuous integration. We will include a .gitignore file to exclude build artifacts and other temporary files from the repository. We will also include a Jenkinsfile to automate the build process and run the JUnit tests.

JUnit Test Cases:
We will write JUnit test cases for the RfqStateMachine and RfqService classes to ensure that the state transition logic and business logic are working as expected.
